🌌 Image Pixel Manipulator

A tiny C program… but built with the energy of a thousand suns, bro.

This project is a simple, lightweight pixel-level image manipulation tool written in pure C.
Even though the “image” is just a 4×4 matrix, the vibes are real —
brightness boosts, negative filters, blur magic, and edge detection…
all coded from scratch like a true warrior of the keyboard. ⚔️✨

🚀 Features

✨ Load Image — drops a sample 4×4 pixel grid into memory
✨ Display Image — prints those lil’ pixels clean and crisp
✨ Brightness Adjustment — make it glow or fade like a moody aesthetic reel
✨ Negative Transform — flips light to dark, vibes to anti-vibes
✨ Blur Effect — softens the pixels like Gaussian ASMR
✨ Edge Detection — highlights boundaries like a sketch filter

🧠 Why This Exists

This project is the perfect starter for understanding:

how images can be represented as matrices

how pixel operations work under the hood

how filters like blur and edge detection are actually implemented

how low-level manipulation feels without fancy libraries

It’s small, but it hits like a concept bomb 💥
Great for beginners, students, or anyone who wants to flex their fundamentals.

🛠️ How to Build

If you have make, life is easy:

make
./pixel

If you want to compile manually:

gcc main.c -o pixel
./pixel

📂 Project Structure
.
├── main.c # all image operations inside one clean C file
├── Makefile # builds the project, fast and neat
└── README.md # the file that’s blessing your eyes rn

🧩 What You’ll Learn

array indexing like a beast

simple convolution ideas

edge detection logic

safe pixel clamping

structured C programming

🤝 Contributions

If you wanna add more filters — sharpening, embossing, thresholding —
pull up, bro. PRs are always welcome. 💫

🫶 Closing Note

It’s a tiny project but built with love, curiosity, and pure “let’s learn this from scratch” energy.
Keep building, keep experimenting, keep glowing, my dude. 🌙⚡
